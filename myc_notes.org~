* performance

Radio Mycelium workshop and opening performance:

Seventeen participants will form an inter-species, human-mycelial
radio performance network, activating the molecular Mycelium Network
Society installation and instantiating an active mycelial/mushroom
audio networked circuit.

Within the mushroom molecule structure seventeen transmission devices
are pre-installed which operate according to local mycelial conditions
and transmit small-scale material change information across wide-band
radio frequencies. These devices will interface with local humidity,
temperature and radio signals within the growing mycelial bodies,
sometimes creating rich signals, sometimes blocking or jamming signals
within a very close space, parasitically riding on local space
electromagnetic emissions.

Prior to the performance, seventeen sound artists will take part in an
open workshop building DIY radio receivers and sculptural antennae,
testing the reception of signals and interfacing with open examples of
the Lingzhi growing mushroom. Throughout the workshop a fungal
dramaturgy will be developed for the opening performance, comprising
acts which are dominated by certain received sets of signals.

During the performance, the seventeen artists will work with spatially
defined radio signals, and moving radio receivers within the
constraints of an eight channel sound system which allows for precise
localisation of sound signals. Artists will also play with their own
approaches to handheld Lingzhi fungi which will serve as audio and
full spectrum instruments. The performance is a collaboration between
electronic sensibilities and the extra human realms of radio frequency
and Lingzhi.

* tech needs

tech needs:

For installation:

Seventeen sensor/transmitter/jammers will be installed - one in each
of the atoms forming the molecule. These devices (custom made
electronics and circuit boards) will examine small-scale material
changes within the mycelial atoms and transmit this information across
wide-band radio frequencies, for later audio spatialisation as part of
the installation. 

8x FM radio receivers/receiver modules in the space 

8x mid-range active monitors (Genelec 8040)

PC and 12 channel soundcard (RME Hammerfall)

Eight channel analogue audio mixer


For performance:

Opening performance will re-work the transmissions from the
molecule/17 transmission devices within the space by 17 local sound
artists.

32 channel analogue audio mixer

17x FM radio receivers

- test import svg in pcbnew: this works following: https://andrehessling.de/2016/09/13/getting-a-custom-board-outline-from-an-svg-file-into-kicad/

- how we connect power and signals between boards - sketch this out

say power/gnd/3.3v/audio1/audio2/ so 5 lines across lower part of each module to be connected

POWER/GND/audio-micro_in/micro audio out/.../pwm with jumper also

... but for micro we also need to break out/across with CLK, SDO, SDI, CS = SPI

and for humidity = ADC or I2C or SPI?

5v connection in...

- different signals: micro-output pwm, input sample/or straight eg. mems micro etc ...
- what are the possible signals
- changing transmission capacitance
- connections to mycelium - also in base
- any special footprints - for sensors
- basic schematic

* what sensors/other devices/electronics we will use?

opamp from microcontroller...

combine some of these and use jumpers or different ADC sample options

1- for temperature we use breakout: MAX31865 - 8 pin break 5V - or with humidity

2- MEMs mic: kicad footprints for INMP504 -3.3v/reflow, HLGA packagings
 
3- humidity: moisture/resistance - in the air, 4-in the mushroom (resistance bridge/ADC)?

5 humidity: SHT15-pricey, SI7021-DFN/cheap, HIH6130-soic/medium**ORDERED-6131, BME280-tricky/medium, - these ones also do temp/what accuracy?  HIH4030-5v/easy/medium/ADC 

6- RF retransmission = antenna into micro-sampled ADC/ antenna amp as in detektor

7- theremin like oscillator: http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Your-Own-Simple-Theremin/ 4093/op-amp

http://interface.khm.de/index.php/lab/interfaces-advanced/theremin-as-a-capacitive-sensing-device/

8- light/spectrometer (light source/detector) - offboard for insertion into mushroom - photodiode(voltage?) and white LED?

as well as basic disruptors//timed signal disrupters - modulated by mushroom itself
